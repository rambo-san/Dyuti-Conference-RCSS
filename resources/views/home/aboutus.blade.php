    <h3> <span>International Consortium for Social Development (ICSD)</span>  </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">Social development processes aim to bring about economic and social improvement in the lives of people through capacity building. Often this involves institution-building and social change. The International Consortium for Social Development (ICSD) is an organization of practitioners, scholars and students in human services.
It was started in the 1970s by a group of social work educators to respond to pressing human concerns from an international, interdisciplinary perspective. The organization seeks to develop conceptual frameworks and effective intervention strategies geared to influencing local, national and international systems. It is committed to creating peaceful solutions to the problems of survival at the local, national and global levels. ICSD members use a social development approach to:

<h3 class="mt-5"><span>Rajagiri College of Social Sciences (Autonomous)</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rajagiri College of Social Sciences (RCSS), together with its sister educational concerns, owes its existence to the CMI (Carmelites of Mary Immaculate) fathers, the first-ever indigenous religious congregation for men in the Syrian Catholic tradition of Christianity in India. The CMIs drawing inspiration from their founding father St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, a great visionary, reformer and religious leader of the 19th century, have proven themselves worthy of that heritage in the field of education by establishing institutions of excellence imparting quality education, across the length and breadth of the State, and in various parts of India. Rajagiri College of Social Sciences (Autonomous) was established as a result of the indefatigable industry and foresight of the CMI. The various axioms of the institution maintain the axiomatic spirit of Rajagiri - ‘Relentlessly Towards Excellence’. Rajagiri College of Social Sciences (RCSS) is the eldest child of Rajagiri Vidyapeedam (Rajagiri group of educational institutions). RAJAGIRI literally means “The Hill of the King '' and derivatively it refers to the hillock where Jesus Christ is accepted as the King or the model, as the human embodiment of the virtues of love, truth and justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rajagiri College of Social Sciences has been placed 30th in the country in the 'Colleges' category by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2023, MHRD, Govt of India.

The institution was reaccredited in the fourth cycle with an A++ grade and with a CGPA of 3.83 by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The College had its origin as a pioneer in professional social work education starting with a Diploma in social service way back in 1955 and adding on Masters in Social Work (MSW), the first of its kind in Kerala State and one of the very few in South India. The College then started under the University of Madras, later came under the University of Kerala and after 1986 affiliated to MG University, Kottayam. The College is presently offering 17 Programmes (Graduate, Postgraduate, Postgraduate Diploma and PhD) under 8 Departments.

<h3 class="mt-5"><span>About the Conference</span></h3>
<h3>24th ICSD Biennial Conference</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Development has been a focus of humankind since ancient times. It involves creating social conditions that sustainably and equitably foster individual and collective well-being. However, the path to development has undergone various debates and changes across different periods, involving shifts in concepts, theories, and practical approaches. The idea of social development emerged when it was felt that true development could not be achieved solely through economic advancement. Its proponents advocated a holistic and multi-level approach, instead. Social development is a broad concept that involves significant changes in politics, economics, and culture, all aimed at transforming society through deliberate efforts, characterised by increased capacity within the social system, social structure, institutions, services, and policies to effectively utilise resources and generate positive changes in the standard of living.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The world is constantly facing challenges in ensuring peace and stability that enable people to live in harmony. War, conflict, poverty, political instability, human rights violations, forced displacement, climate change etc. call for a united effort if we are to advance the UN’s sustainable development goals. Social workers and social development professionals play a vital role in addressing the many challenges faced by individuals, communities, and societies. It is essential to view ‘development’ as a process as well as an outcome, realizing that achieving such an aim requires engagement with multiple stakeholders to find inclusive pathways, especially for the most marginalized and vulnerable communities. As a concept in social work, social work practices at the micro, meso, and macro levels have a considerable role in social development. As the world moves swiftly towards the post-modern era, innovations in areas such as new approaches to service delivery, technology integration, policy changes and community organising strategies, are necessary to achieve the desired end.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ICSD 24th Biennial International Conference aims to provide an opportunity to critically reflect on the multiple ways in which social work and social development professionals have advanced innovative solutions to unite and improve outcomes for individuals, families and communities, locally and globally. The conference will also celebrate ICSD’s golden jubilee; showcasing its commendable contribution to the field of social work and social development worldwide.
