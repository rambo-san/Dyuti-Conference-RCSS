<h2 style="color:#0b0b8b;font-weight:bold;"> Call for Papers/Proposals </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> We are calling for papers (for oral and poster presentations) that bring together novel solutions to development issues through social work and social development practices. All kinds of innovations will be considered, whether they are methodological, theoretical, social, technological, policy, practice-based, or organizational, and are of local relevance and/or have the potential for large-scale replication. Lessons learned from adopting and implementing evidence-based solutions, as well as how politics and questions of good governance, shape social development outcomes, are pertinent to this call. Learning across disciplines, forging partnerships for social change, and finding contextually appropriate solutions, as well as critiques of current solutions, are welcome. </p>
